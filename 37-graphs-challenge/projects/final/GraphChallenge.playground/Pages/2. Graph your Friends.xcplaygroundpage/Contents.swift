 # 2. Graph your Friends
 
 Vincent has three friends, Chesley, Ruiz, and Patrick. Ruiz has friends Ray, Sun, and a mutual friend with Vincent's. Patrick is friends with Cole, and Kerry. Cole is friends with Ruiz and Vincent. Create an adjacency list that represents this friendship graph. Which mutual friend do Ruiz and Vincent share?
