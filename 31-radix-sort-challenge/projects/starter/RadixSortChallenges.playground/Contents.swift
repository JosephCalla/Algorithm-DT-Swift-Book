//: # Radix Sort Challenges
//: ## Challenge 1: Most significant digit
//:
//: The implementation discussed in the chapter used a *least significant digit*
//: radix sort. Your task is to implement a *most significant digit* radix sort.
//: This sorting behavior is called **lexicographical sorting** and is also used
//: for `String` sorting.
//:
//:  For example:
//:
//: ```swift
//: var array = [500, 1345, 13, 459, 44, 999]
//: array.lexicographicalSort()
//: print(array) // outputs [13, 1345, 44, 459, 500, 999]
//: ```
// Your answer here
